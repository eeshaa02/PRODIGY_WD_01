**Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Menu**

This project is a simple, responsive landing page with a fixed navigation menu. The navigation menu has interactive features such as changing color when the user scrolls the page and changing style when a menu item is hovered over.

**Features**
- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar stays at the top of the page as you scroll, providing easy access to different sections.
- **Scroll Interactivity**: The background and font colors of the navigation bar change when the page is scrolled down.
- **Hover Interactivity**: The menu items change their background and text color when hovered over, creating a more engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for smaller screens, making the page mobile-friendly.

 **Demo**

The landing page includes the following sections:
1. **Home**
2. **About**
3. **Services**
4. **Contact**

The navigation menu allows users to jump directly to each section.

 **Technologies Used**

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, including hover and scroll effects.
- **JavaScript**: For adding dynamic interactivity to the navigation bar, such as changing its background when scrolled.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
.
├── index.html      # The main HTML file
├── styles.css      # CSS file to style the page and navigation
└── scripts.js      # JavaScript file to handle scroll interactions
```

### 1. `index.html`
Contains the structure of the navigation bar and the sections of the landing page (Home, About, Services, Contact).

### 2. `styles.css`
Defines the styles for the navigation bar, hover effects on the links, and the layout of the page. The navigation menu's background and text color change when the user scrolls down, and the design adjusts for smaller screens using media queries.

### 3. `scripts.js`
Handles the interactivity for the scroll behavior. When the page is scrolled down more than 50px, the background of the navigation bar changes, giving a visual indication of scrolling.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the page in action.

## Customization

- **Change Colors**: You can change the colors of the navigation bar, hover effects, or section backgrounds by modifying the `styles.css` file.
- **Add More Sections**: If you want to add more sections to the page, simply add more `<section>` elements in the `index.html` file, and adjust the navigation menu accordingly.
